## Atomic Design and Components

This project uses the Atomic Design approach for structuring its components. Atomic Design is a methodology that divides the user interface into five distinct levels:

1. **Atoms**: The most basic components, such as buttons, inputs, labels.
2. **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms that form functional units.
3. **Organisms**: Groups of molecules that form distinct sections of an interface.
4. **Templates**: Page layouts that organize organisms and molecules.
5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates with actual content.

### Our Components

Following this methodology, our components are organized as follows:

- **Atoms**: 

  
- **Molecules**:

  
- **Organisms**:

  
- **Templates**:

  
- **Pages**:
